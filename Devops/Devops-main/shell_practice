instruction save && output terminal





    command > output.txt

    The standard output stream will be redirected to the file only, it will not be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

    command >> output.txt

    The standard output stream will be redirected to the file only, it will not be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.

    command 2> output.txt

    The standard error stream will be redirected to the file only, it will not be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

    command 2>> output.txt

    The standard error stream will be redirected to the file only, it will not be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.

    command &> output.txt

    Both the standard output and standard error stream will be redirected to the file only, nothing will be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

    command &>> output.txt

    Both the standard output and standard error stream will be redirected to the file only, nothing will be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file..

    command | tee output.txt

    The standard output stream will be copied to the file, it will still be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

    command | tee -a output.txt

    The standard output stream will be copied to the file, it will still be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.

    (*)

    Bash has no shorthand syntax that allows piping only StdErr to a second command, which would be needed here in combination with tee again to complete the table. If you really need something like that, please look at "How to pipe stderr, and not stdout?" on Stack Overflow for some ways how this can be done e.g. by swapping streams or using process substitution.

    command |& tee output.txt

    Both the standard output and standard error streams will be copied to the file while still being visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

    command |& tee -a output.txt

    Both the standard output and standard error streams will be copied to the file while still being visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.

in my case, keyboard interrupt not work during install ros-melodic. then, i force reboot using cli
=> after, generate apt-get dependency error

apt-get dependency problems - leaving unconfigured [closed] :

 package is in a very bad inconsistent state; you should
 reinstall it before attempting configuration

dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of geoclue-2.0:

  Package libavahi-glib1:amd64 is not configured yet.

No apport report written because the error message indicates its a followup error from a previous failure.

Errors were encountered while processing:
 ros-melodic-desktop-rosbash
 geoclue-2.0
 libgeoclue-2-0:amd64
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)



solution :
sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-rosbash --reinstall


option (python-rosdep error) : 
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/info/*
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt update -y



tar destination option : 
tar xf file.tar.gz -C /root/Desktop/folder


Fixed by :slight_smile: sudo dpkg -P --force-all PACKAGETOREMOVE etc. from the "Stuck in the loop" article

Resolution

To create a compressed disk image with "dd" :

    Boot into rescue mode with the installation media

    Create a mount point for your external drive:
    Raw

    # mkdir /mnt/external

    Mount your external drive:
    Raw

    # mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/external

    Create the compressed disk image:
    Raw

    # dd if=/dev/sda | gzip -9 > /mnt/external/filename.img.gz

To recover this in future, run the following command :
Raw

# zcat /mnt/external/filename.img.gz | dd of=/dev/sda
